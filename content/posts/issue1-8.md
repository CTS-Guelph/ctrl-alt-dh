Summary:

## Introduction

These infographics contextualize and explain overarching information about the CTRL+ALT+DH journal and information about what a journal is in general. The infographic titled What is CTRL+ALT+DH? informs the reader of pertinent information to the CTRL+ALT+DH journal. What is CTRL+ALT+DH has eight sections: CTS Student Journal; The Team; Journal Issues; Submissions; Format; Peer Review; Open-Source; Copyright and Citations. These sections outline specifics about how the journal functions and its publishing processes. The second infographic Journal Publishing defines the uses/practices of journals and articles and explains the various components needed to create an article. 

Future students submitting infographics to CTRL+ALT+DH need to ensure that their piece’s topic(s) can be condensed without loss of valuable information. The surface area provided to create an infographic can be deceiving as there is less space to work with than initially perceived. Infographics must be visually pleasing and not overly content-heavy to allow for ease of comprehension.

The ideal infographic submission would be in PDF format as it is compatible with the majority of online tools, software, and any hardware that may be used to access the CTRL+ALT+DH platform.
