Bio: Jessica Cela is a Landscape Architecture student in her final year at the University of Guelph. After graduation, she aspires to pursue a career in Landscape Architecture, focusing on Playground design and Community Design. Jessica is a creative person who enjoys working on different types of projects like graphic design, landscape design, and photography. The displayed project is a collage that shows the comparison between Walkman, a common music player in the 2000s, and modern technology. Just by having the pieces of technology next to each other, we can see how modern technology has advanced. It went from technology being functionally only with wires to wireless. When submitting a project in this format, it is important to follow journal guidelines in what they are looking for and create something that is especially well organised. Collages can sometimes have too much content on one canvas losing its message.

## Introduction:
In 'From Wires to Wireless,' this artwork encapsulates the evolution of music technology across generations. Centred around a Walkman from the 2000s, surrounded by modern devices like iPhones and iPads, the piece visually narrates the shift from wired to wireless technology. It highlights the swift progression from physical media to the seamless convenience of digital access, symbolising not just a transformation in how music is enjoyed but also in the broader evolution of technological integration in daily life. Through contrasting imagery, it invites reflection on the enduring love for music amidst the ever-evolving landscape of innovation and connectivity.
