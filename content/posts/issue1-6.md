## Episode Description

Jared, Arya, Leah, and Jessica discuss the process of creating CTS*4000’s student journal on pop culture. Within this podcast, we get the chance to discuss what drove us to start this journal, along with how our groups were structured and the difficulties that we encountered during the semester. We were able to dive into exciting pop culture topics like virtual fashion shows and cryptocurrencies and even discuss future topics of interest like music, film, and sports. Our discussion also covers pop culture's impact on emotions and its significance to students as a means to escape reality during difficult times like exam seasons. As a group, we also touched on the topic of augmented reality and how that will impact our generation.

When discussing advice for future students looking to submit a project similar to ours, I suggest everybody record their own parts on their own phone to ensure all audio is even when it comes to editing. I was able to take all of our individual parts and edit out the background feedback on Garageband (any music software would work).
