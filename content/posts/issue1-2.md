Bio: Jacquelyn is currently finishing her undergraduate degree majoring in Culture and Technology Studies, with a minor in Human Resources. In the future, she hopes to work within the areas of information science, organizational behaviour, and digital sustainability.

This timeline is a summary of the work completed for the creation of the CTRL+ALT+DH journal over the course of two semesters. It provides a condensed summary of the tasks completed by effectively summarizing significant turning points and milestones in the journal's construction. The information in the timeline is similar to a thorough log of the dates of significant tasks completed. It serves as a useful guide for future students in addition to being beneficial for reflecting on how the project developed in the past.

A student working on a project with a similar structure should be aware of how important it is to document the dates and work done by students each week. This allows for information to be organized and easily accessible for the students.Â
