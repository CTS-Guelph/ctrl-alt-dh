Summary: Editorial for the Issue 0 of CTRL-ALT-DH


# Welcome to CTRL+ALT+DH!

We are an online, open-access undergraduate journal from the [Culture and Technology Studies (CTS)](https://www.uoguelph.ca/arts/cts) program at the University of Guelph. 

CTRL+ALT+DH emerges from the collective vision of CTS students and professors to create a space where dynamic, intellectual projects in digital humanities can be distributed. For the past five months, the inaugural team of student editors has worked together to integrate traditional journal publishing conventions with the growing suite of digital tools. It has been a challenging process, but we are motivated by our desire to create a journal that captures the interdisciplinary nature of the digital humanities. Specifically, we envision a multi-media publication that integrates our contributors' understanding of current topics in a data-driven world, and our work in the CTS program. The goal is to share undergraduate work outside of the classroom with the global community. 

The name of our journal, CTRL+ALT+DH, references first-generation computing and the combination of actions needed to shake loose from a non-responsive program, or restart completely. It is a nod to what has come before, and the desire to move forward and explore new ways of working within digital realms. It is a culmination of our work as CTS students, and highlights the inextricable link between the human experience and technology. CTRL+ALT+DH invites work that engages current discourse around the complex relationships between power, digital knowledge, digital cultures, and the representation of data.

We are excited to publish our first issue in Fall 2023 and begin accepting submissions from the CTS undergraduate community. Whether it is your curiosity about technology, gaming, art, creative writing, or one of many other topics, we look forward to seeing the great projects you are able to create. We are excited to see CTRL+ALT+DH grow and thrive. Thank you for joining us in what we hope will be a rewarding experience for students and readers alike for years to come.


Your Winter 2023 editorial collective,
