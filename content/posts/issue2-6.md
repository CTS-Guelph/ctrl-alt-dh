Abstract: To VC or Not to VC, my final project for CTS1000 (2023). Wordcount of ~800, mixed media physical collage, made of various materials, including (but not limited to), graph paper, construction paper, adhesive tape, glue, stickers, ink markers, acrylic paint, as well as cut-outs from 2 magazines: Anatomy Essentials by Future plc, and The Nib Issue 15, a social, political, and scientific comic collective by various artists. Creating a traditional zine rather than a digitally rendered zine was challenging and tedious, however, the result was visually complex and effectively presented itself as both an informational and artistic piece. Utilizing the template of a zine to present research was also relevant to the chosen keyword related to the assignment, "gender". In the 80s and 90s, zines such as Shocking Pink, Bikini Kill, and Doris were published by feminist movement groups to spread information that was not present in the news and media. Creating zines is a challenging form of art and a historical form of publicity, and holds great importance to display and pay homage to the relationship it has with the history of gender and feminism.
