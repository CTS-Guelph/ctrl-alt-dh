## Introduction:

In today’s digital age, art exhibitions have transcended physical boundaries, offering immersive experiences that are accessible from the comfort of our homes. “Alive in their garden” is a prime example of this evolution, showcasing the works of four talented Black Latinx artists in a virtual museum. This exhibition isn’t just a collection of artworks, it is an interactive journey through themes of gender, ecology, ancestry, and healing, presented through a mix of photography, sculpture, and digital installations.

## Background on Exhibit Artists:

In our exploration of “Alive in their garden,” we are introduced to a collection of artists whose work is as diverse as their backgrounds, yet united by a common thread of exploring identity, nature, and resistance. Joiri Minaya is a Dominican-American artist from New-York. Her art stands out for its vibrant depictions of natural landscapes, from serene beaches to captivating bodies of water, all interwoven with the beauty and diversity of women’s bodies. Felli Maynard is an artist based in New-York. His photography represents a stunning portrayal of Queer Black individuals, often depicted in their natural element and sometimes partially nude, in creative and evocative poses. These images go beyond the surface to explore themes of vulnerability, strength, freedom, and authenticity. Star Feliz is Dominican-American artist from Los Angeles who uses her connection to the earth to question old colonial ideas. Inspired by her Afro-Taino roots, she works with sounds, sculptures, films, and even the earth itself to talk about healing and fighting against these legacies. Finally, Nitzayra Leonor is a Black, Afro-descendant Puerto Rican and Caribbean woman who brings a multi-layered approach to her art, utilizing engraving, photography, body art, and ceramics to construct a language that is deeply personal and reflective of her identity. Leonor’s work is a testament to the power of art to capture and communicate complex narratives of heritage, memory, and identity.

## How the Exhibition Works:

### 1. Navigating the Virtual Space From Above

When you first enter “Alive In their garden,” you initially encounter a 360 panoramic view of the museum and its detailed floor plan. This panoramic view gives you a comprehensive bird’s-eye view of the entire space, laying out the art and rooms before you. Then, it shifts to a dollhouse view, which zooms in closer, showing the museum’s layout in 3D. This lets you virtually walk through the exhibition, moving from room to room and piece to piece as if you were there in person.

### 2. Exploring Art Up Close

After the panoramic view, you dive into the exhibition using the floor plan to move freely with your cursor. Directly head towards any artwork that grabs your attention. This interactive exploration lets you control your journey, room by room, piece by piece. Once you click on an artwork, a sidebar pops up, sharing the artwork’s story, its title, and the artist’s name. This feature turns every click into a chance for a deeper connection with the art, letting you uncover the rich narratives and ideas behind each piece.

## Reflection

“Alive in their garden” immerses us in the worlds of race, gender, ethnicity, and identity, seen through the creative expressions of Black Latinx artists. The exhibition stands out for its dynamic representation of diversity and empowerment, not just in themes, but also in the vivid images and photographs displayed. The project does an exceptional job of showcasing race in a way that goes beyond just skin color. Race encompasses heritage, identity, and the many ways in which people connect with their roots.

Through various artistic forms, such as installations and photographs of people from diverse racial backgrounds, the exhibition brings together a narrative that celebrates race as a crucial part of our identity. It is not just about the differences in our appearance, it is about the stories, cultures, and histories that shape us. In doing so, “Alive in their garden” paints a picture of human life in all its variety, encouraging us to embrace and understand the wide range of experiences and backgrounds that make up our world. By presenting these stories and images, the exhibition invites us to reflect on our own identities and the rich variety of society. It opens up a space for conversation and learning, where visitors can explore the complexities of identity and culture in a welcoming and enlightening environment. Ultimately, “Alive in their garden” serves not just as an exhibition but as a vibrant place for exploring and celebrating the diverse surface of human identity. It encourages us to look beyond superficial differences and find value in the stories and heritage that make each person unique. Through this lens, the exhibition promotes empathy, respect, and unity in a world that often seems divided.

This exhibition is definitely empowering, and here’s a simple way to see why. By diving into their cultural backgrounds and personal stories, the artists give us a closer look at Afro-Taino heritage and the complex world of identity. This sharing is empowering because it helps people, especially those with similar backgrounds, to see their own stories and history in the art. It is like being told, “Your experiences, your heritage, and who you are, are important.” Also, using a virtual platform makes the exhibition even more accessible. It breaks down the usual barriers that might stop people from getting to see art like where they live, not having enough money, or not being able to get there physically. This open door to everyone is empowering because more people can see, learn, and feel inspired by these strong and diverse stories. At its heart, it is about showing off the beauty of our differences and encouraging us to understand and appreciate each other, making it a great source of inspiration and connection. The virtual aspect also enables a global conversation, inviting feedback and dialogue from around the world, which improves the experience for both artists and viewers. This global exchange of ideas and perspectives can lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the diversity that exists within and across cultures. In essence, this exhibition uses the power of art to bridge gaps, connect communities, and illuminate the richness of human diversity. It is not just about viewing art, it is about engaging with it on a personal level and finding common ground in the stories it tells. This level of engagement and accessibility is what makes the exhibition truly empowering, offering a mirror to see ourselves and a window to view others, fostering empathy and solidarity in our increasingly interconnected world.

While the project is empowering, expanding the range of voices to include more underrepresented communities could enhance its inclusivity and representational depth. The interface’s immersive design, like its panoramic views and interactive features, skillfully conveys the artists’ stories, but integrating more educational resources and contextual information could deepen the understanding of the themes presented. Additionally, considering the exhibition’s availability in both English and Spanish, there is a clear opportunity to extend language options, welcoming even more diverse audiences.

“Alive in their garden” makes a strong argument about the inclusivity of different identities, including race, gender and ethnicity, through its diverse range of subjects captured in photographs and its varied installations that delve into heritage. The artwork showcases a spectrum of experiences and backgrounds, illustrating the diverse mix of human identity. The way the interface is designed plays a big part in conveying this argument. Its user-friendly navigation allows visitors to explore these themes at their own pace, with the option to dive deeper into each piece through interactive elements. This setup not just showcases the diversity of content but also makes the experience personal and accessible, inviting users to engage with and reflect on the stories of identity and difference presented. Moreover, the decision to make “Alive in their garden” accessible in two languages speaks to the commitment to inclusivity, demonstrating an awareness of the need for broader accessibility. This effort highlights the exhibition’s focus on being inclusive, making sure that its celebration of diverse identities and backgrounds can be shared with as many people as possible.

Sourcing artwork from a diverse group of artists ensures a rich variety of perspectives and narratives that encompass different aspects of identity and experience. The digital exhibit is curated with innovative techniques, allowing visitors to use tools like data visualization to explore patterns, themes, and connections among the pieces. By integrating art simulation and VR technology, the project transforms static images into a dynamic and engaging experience, opening up new possibilities for how users interact with the art in virtual spaces.
