This twine game is a simplified example of what your submission may look like. Here you will find information regarding file recommendations for each format, important resources for writing citations and abstracts, and some general guidelines to consider. 

It is important to remember that following the submission of your Twine as an .html file, we require an abstract and author biography to be written and submitted as well. Ensure that your submission follows the criteria for the theme of the issue, and don’t forget to cite your work.
