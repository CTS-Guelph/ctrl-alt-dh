CTRL+ALT+DH is an online, open-access undergraduate journal from the Culture and Technology Studies (CTS) program at the University of Guelph. 

The name comes from our focus on the digital humanities and online tools. CTRL+ALT+DH is a platform for CTS students to create dynamic and intellectual projects around digital humanities. Our goal is to integrate our contributors’ understanding of current frameworks from the perspective of the CTS program. 

As a multi-media publication powered by students in the CTS program, we welcome all CTS undergraduate students to engage with existing publications and even consider submitting your own! Whether it is your curiosity about technology, gaming, art, or creative writing! We hope to see the great projects you are able to create. CTRL+ALT+DH exists to ensure that the work of CTS students is distributed outside of the classroom to a global audience.
