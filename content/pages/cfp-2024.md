## Theme: Digital Dilemmas

Digital tools and technologies are reshaping how we engage with information, culture, and communication, but they also present new dilemmas. From ethical concerns surrounding data privacy and AI to the implications of algorithmic bias, environmental impacts, and mental health awareness, our theme asks contributors to critically explore the opportunities and challenges that these dilemmas pose and to consider potential future solutions. 

## Focus Areas:

We encourage submissions on the following topics but welcome any innovative work that engages with the topic of Digital Dilemmas, including critical questions such as:

- **Technological Accessibility:** How can digital technologies be made more inclusive and accessible to all communities, especially marginalized groups?

- **Environmental Impacts of Technology:** How do digital technologies contribute to environmental sustainability or degradation?

- **Artificial Intelligence:** What are the ethical and social implications of AI in society, including questions around bias, automation, and human-AI collaboration?

- **Digital Representation:** Who is represented in digital spaces, and why? How do issues of identity, power, and inclusion play out in digital environments?

- **Digital Art:** How does art in the age of technology create digital dilemmas, such as AI-generated artworks, and questions of authorship?

- **Damaged/Lost Records:** What are the challenges and strategies for dealing with damaged or lost digital records in archival and preservation contexts?

- **Social Media and Technology in Academia:** What is the impact of social media and other technologies on education and academic research?

- **Mental Health and Digital Media:** How is mental health awareness represented on the web? What are the impacts of mass media and technology on well-being, and how do they shape public discourse?

- **Diversity & Discrimination:** How do digital spaces perpetuate or challenge issues of discrimination and inequality?

- **Digital Privacy and Surveillance:** How do we navigate the complexities of data privacy, surveillance, and personal security in the digital age?
