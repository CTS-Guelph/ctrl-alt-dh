## Theme: A Byte of Creativity

In the hyper-digital society that we live in today, creativity just seems to be evolving continuously. Is this good or bad? Well perhaps it can be both. From digital games to NFTs, Data visualizations to and Gen AI art, how is technology transforming the way  we create, value, and share art? What are the new opportunities and challenges faced by the next generation of?  

## Focus Areas: 

- **We encourage submissions on the following topics but welcome any innovative work that engages with the topic of A Byte of Creativity including but not limited to:**  

  - **Mixed Media Work: Art isn’t just made with a paintbrush! How do digital realms foster            different methods of making such as digital games, NFTs, data illustrations, and more? How       does traditional art making intersect with digital tools and technologies? 

  - **Creative Processes: How has the digital world impacted creative processes? Think about all       steps: from drafting to displaying.  

  - **Accessibility/Opportunity: Are there barriers to practicing creativity in digital spaces—        how can technology exacerbate hierarchies, imbalances, and inequities? On the other hand,        can digital spaces provide increased equality, access, or opportunities? 

  - **Jobs and Labour: Professional creatives have been necessarily pushed into the digital. How      has this affected the livelihood of artists? Who benefits and who does not? 

    - **Collaboration: Do digital spaces allow for increased connectivity between creatives, or       between creator and audience? Do they stifle connectivity? Has technology  changed the way       creative collaboration occurs?  

    - **Indigenous Making: Indigenous practices are often regarded as deeply practical and            rooted in tangible, real-world experiences. What happens when traditional Indigenous             technologies and cultural practices of making meet the digital realm? In addition to             contemporary Indigenous authors and artists who use digital tools, you may also consider         speculative and sci-fi work that creates and envisions possible futures for Indigenous           peoples. 

    - **Gen AI: AI and creativity have been a hot topic! Let's get into the good, the bad, and        the ugly. Feel free to think beyond generative visual media, like music and writing. 

    - **Deepfakes: A uniquely digital, arguably creative, AI tool that has allowed for                 appropriation and in some minds, innovation. What are your thoughts?
