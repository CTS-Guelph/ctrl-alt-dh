Welcome! This is the home of the **CTRL+ALT+DH**, the Undergraduate Student Journal of the University of Guelph's [Culture and Technology Studies](https://www.uoguelph.ca/programs/culture-and-technology-studies/) program.

The journal website was built using the Python-based [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/) static site generator. The design was adapted from the [notmyidea](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/tree/main/pelican/themes/notmyidea) default theme.


**Getting Started:**

*For more detailed instructions, see [Pelican's official documentation](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html).*

1. First, [Install Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/install.html).
2. Then, download or clone the CTRL-ALT-DH GitHub Repository.
3. To generate the website, start a new terminal session. Then navigate to the main directory and in Terminal run this Pelican command:
```
pelican content
```
4. To preview changes, open a new Terminal tab and run this Pelican comand:
```
pelican --listen
```
