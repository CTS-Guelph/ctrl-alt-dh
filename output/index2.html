        <div class="abstract"><h3>Abstract</h3> <p>This poem was part of a series for my second-year Culture and Technology Studies course, CTS*2010: Digital Approaches to Culture. Over the course of the semester, I explored the position of microchips in our political economy and the part they play in our future-building. Through my research, it became clear that microchips have an integral role in our digital development, and that the systems in which they are used and developed are deeply integrated into the fabric of the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy. Inspired by the exploration of 'low theory' by Judith Jack Halberstam and Steven Johnson's description of 'the adjacent possible', this piece asserts the role of radical imagination in decoupling technology from systems of oppression.</p></div>

        <div class="abstract"><h3>Abstract</h3> <p>While YouTube apology videos have become their own genre subject to parody, analysis of them has been minimal and limited. It is partly difficult to do so because some creators delete their videos when they receive backlash for a supposedly poor or inauthentic apology. We are interested in the performance of remorse and used internet archival tools to create the largest known dataset of YouTube apologies, which includes video metrics as well as YouTuber demographic information. This paper outlines the methods through which we recovered this lost internet data and prepared it for topic modelling, the type of data collected, as well as how we redirected the project as obstacles arose. This paper is adapted from a final project submitted for the University of Guelph course CTS*3000: Data and Difference in the spring of 2023. It was jointly written by the three authors. The project was originally on the performance and authenticity of a public YouTube apology but became an exercise in data collection and cleaning. As undergraduate students who are interested in such processes and invested in the visibility and recognition of academic labour, in this paper, we discuss things that did and did not work, with the primary aim of helping others who may be interested in similar research.</p></div>

        <div class="abstract"><h3>Abstract</h3> <p>“Nothing in Life is Free” was written in response to the 2020 Massey Lecture series in which Ron Diebert calls for a “reset” on our use and overreliance on technology. Although this piece was written for a grade twelve English course, as noted by the reviewer, it ties in “many lessons learned in CTS classrooms” while touching on many of the dilemmas posed by current digital communication environments. Blending my own reflections on growing up in late-stage capitalism with references to literary texts and Diebert’s research, this personal essay questions the paradox of “free” in a society that binds our physical and digital existence, entangling us in systems of control under the promise of liberation.</p></div>

        <div class="abstract"><h3>Abstract</h3> <p>To VC or Not to VC, my final project for CTS1000 (2023). Wordcount of ~800, mixed media physical collage, made of various materials, including (but not limited to), graph paper, construction paper, adhesive tape, glue, stickers, ink markers, acrylic paint, as well as cut-outs from 2 magazines: Anatomy Essentials by Future plc, and The Nib Issue 15, a social, political, and scientific comic collective by various artists. Creating a traditional zine rather than a digitally rendered zine was challenging and tedious, however, the result was visually complex and effectively presented itself as both an informational and artistic piece. Utilizing the template of a zine to present research was also relevant to the chosen keyword related to the assignment, "gender". In the 80s and 90s, zines such as Shocking Pink, Bikini Kill, and Doris were published by feminist movement groups to spread information that was not present in the news and media. Creating zines is a challenging form of art and a historical form of publicity, and holds great importance to display and pay homage to the relationship it has with the history of gender and feminism.</p></div>

        <div class="abstract"><h3>Abstract</h3> <p>This paper explores how knowledge is produced on Wikipedia and shares the challenges and successes of an ally contributing to feminist subjects on the platform. It examines how knowledge is constructed, evaluated, and contested on Wikipedia - particularly regarding entries of or about marginalized individuals. Wikipedia’s policies and underlying logic are thus critiqued, underscoring the challenges in creating articles on feminist periodicals, revealing oppressive forces and systemic biases rooted in the platform's community-based editorial policies. Additionally, the paper suggests strategies for circumventing these obstacles, advocating for feminists and allies to engage in reshaping the platform's content. Ultimately, this essay calls for internal reform and external alternatives to support inclusive representation of human knowledge.</p></div>
