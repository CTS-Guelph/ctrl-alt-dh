<p>This poem was part of a series for my second-year Culture and Technology Studies course, CTS*2010 Digital Approaches to Culture. Over the course of the semester, I explored the position of microchips in our political economy and the part they play in our future-building. Through my research, it became clear that microchips have an integral role in our digital development, and that the systems in which they are used and developed are deeply integrated into the fabric of the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy. I believe that the decoupling of technology from systems of oppression relies first on radical imagination.</p>
<p>This piece is therefore inspired by Steven Johnson’s account of the adjacent possible - “a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself”<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>– and the assertion by pacifist scholar Elsie Boulding that “the sheer difficulty of imagining future sustainability different from the present is one of our greatest problems as a society”<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. To explore this idea, I drew from the work of queer academic Judith Jack Halberstam and their idea of ‘low theory’ and the silly archive (2012; 2014)<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. I chose particularly to look at the potential of children’s stories to imagine alternative futures. </p>
<p>Halberstam argues that children’s media, a form of ‘low theory’, can be a powerful source of revolutionary content, and help us to imagine alternative futures and ways of being (2014) <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. For me, thinking about this immediately brought to mind Dr. Seuss, a staple on the bookshelves of me and many others. Stories like The Lorax, Thidwick the Big Hearted Moose, and Horton Hears a Who! all strongly resonate with this theme for me, and even the graduation classic Oh, the Places You’ll Go! emphasizes the expansive possibility that lies in the future.</p>
<p>Through all of these inspirations, I wrote and recorded a Dr. Seuss-inspired children’s poem about the adjacent possibility that exists in the technology we build and the world we move towards.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>A Million Tomorrows</h2>
<p>There’s a place near your town,
not too far ways away.
If you got going at sunrise
you'd be there by midday.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In that place lives a being.
Not from there, not not,
the same way that you are from more than one spot.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You're a fine mixture of all that you've seen!
It took much to shape you,
as it took for this being.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you went to visit, as I urge you to do,
a wondrous happening could happen to you!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know this for sure -
I've been there, you see,
and this wondrous happening happened to me!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The happening happened on a regular day.
With everything going the regular way.
The weather was weathering, not cold and not hot.
Things were being done, but not a whole lot.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Time was just ticking the way that it does.
The bees were just buzzing their regular buzz.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I remember deciding to go for a walk.
Not to get somewhere, just to ride out the clock.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Where I was going I hadn't a clue,
I just followed each foot, which followed each shoe,
which followed the path that goes down by the river.
I followed it as it as it shrank down to a sliver.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As I walked,
I felt the air starting to change.
Something was different…
I sensed something strange.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The sense I was sensing started to grow.
How to describe it?
To this day I don’t know…</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I felt around me a remarkable feeling,
of stillness and calm,
of peaceful healing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This all was quite pleasant, and I’d now walked quite a bit.
I’d walked a good walking, now I wanted to sit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So I sat on a bench conveniently placed
on the edge of a field, facing the space.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The sun was now setting,
bowing gently goodnight.
Making room for an equally gentle twilight.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The crickets greeted the frogs.
The breeze was magic and restless.
The state of the evening really left me quite breathless!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And that’s when I saw them, drawing slowly nearer.
Walking through the field, their figure getting clearer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“Why hello there!”  they said, their face holding a smile,
“You’ve got quite the view, could I sit for a while?”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“Why of course!” I replied. “Timba’s the name.”
“Nice to meet you”, they answered. “My name’s Leraime.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I said to Leraime,
“I was just watching you sow.
Things seem so peaceful out there,
and so slow.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>“Yes,” they replied.
“I’ve learned to move slow.
I’ve learned moving fast is just one way to go.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They were quiet a bit.
Then they said,
“It would be great if we all
would move slower instead.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We run from Point A
just to get to Point B,
which is funny because
we’d rather be at Point D!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We build things to help us
build with more speed,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Without asking if fast
is the speed that we need!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When we’ve had a hard day,
and things have been tough,
we imagine the reason
is we weren’t doing enough.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We think about everything we’re yet to do,
the million things we didn’t get around to.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>‘I need to go faster,’
we’ll say with resolve,
assuming that that’s how our problems are solved.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So tomorrow,
we get out of bed and we RUN,
and still not everything seems to get done.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When we’ve done what we can,
when the day is all spent,
tomorrow seems to have gone
just how yesterday went.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Lots of running and doing and moving and shaking,
trying to see all the progress we’re making.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you decide
you can’t keep running this way,
a Big Man will swoop in to come save the day.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He’ll say,
‘Look at all of this running you do!
You look quite exhausted!
you tired thing, you.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Big Man will conveniently fail to say 
that HE’S  the reason you're running this way!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>His family told everyone a long time ago,
that running’s the only good way to go.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And now he gets paid
just to watch people run.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He just sits and makes sure
that good running is done</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He has but one task:
make sure runners don’t quit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He makes runners run
So that sitters can sit!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So when this Big Man sees you starting to rest…
he swoops in to do
the thing he does best!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He’ll come up to your door,
and before you can blink,
he’ll be in your kitchen
helping himself to a drink!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He’ll sit on your sofa,
assume you don’t mind.
(Typical sitter behaviour, you’ll find!)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He’ll say,
‘I have the solution for you.
It’ll change your whole life!
I promise, it’s true!’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He promises something.
Something for your running.
He assures you your rest time
is almost coming!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The next thing he’ll do
is sell you a gadget.
He'll tell you it's magic!
That you have to have it. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He'll say,
‘This humble doodad is meant
 to reduce runners’ running by 300 per cent!’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>‘If you want to buy this,
come down to my shop. 
Running'll be so easy.
you won't want to stop!’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One of the greatest things he has pitched
has helped him and his friends get incredibly rich. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The thing that he sold
was the tiniest chip.
Smaller than the teeniest tiniest pip.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Smaller than the germs that crawl on your hand,
almost as small as a DNA strand!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He sold it to us.
He promised great things.
If we wanted to stop running,
well, these were our wings!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In radios, in phones,
in fridges, and cars -
We'd stop running soon,
The day couldn't be far!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This chip now powers most things that we use:
it’s in fridges and phones,
even basketball shoes.
The big man grows rich
selling us these,
telling us we can keep running with ease.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But somehow running still doesn't seem easy.
Nothing about what we do seems more breezy. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The reason, I'll tell you -
and this is true -
the chips are not for the me or the yous.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Or the people digging minerals out in the mines,
or assembling our phones out in factory lines. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All of us keep running,
but now at a sprint,
with this microchip tech as encouragement. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Big Man keeps on sitting
with a smile on his face,
as we keep on running
at incredible pace. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But here's something he doesn't want you to see:
running is not the only way to be!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There's walking and swimming
and skipping and flying
and dancing and standing
and sitting and lying. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Big Men want you to run
because it grows their wealth. 
They make you comply
using wiles and stealth.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But when all the running
becomes much too much,
it's useful to say,
‘No, I think that's enough. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All of these gizmos
do indeed help me run,
but I think I've decided
that running's no fun.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It's not that I don't think they're nifty.
I do.
I just don't need a chip inside of my shoe.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And having a credit card chip in my hand?
To be honest, I don't really get the demand.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It's just another form of money, you know.
I don't think it's progress if it maintains status quo.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I look at the future,
I think of my past.
I assume that the next day
Will look like the last.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But I’m tired.
I don’t want to run anymore.
That can’t be all
My existence is for.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>He'll shiver! He'll shake!
He'll beg and he’ll plead.
He'll say, ‘Okay then...
Well, what do you need?’
You can think for a moment.
And then you can say,
‘I'd like to do things
some other way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We seem to think
if this tech does this thing
then that's all it does.
That that's all it can bring.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And I like these chips. 
I could like them a lot.
So why don't we see
what else you've got? </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Something that lets me
be slower, more chill.
Something a little more...
walk-y, if you will.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You could say that, you know.
And you'd be sure to find
that many people have thoughts of this kind.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If we all came together,
if we stopped running today,
our tomorrow could go
a whole different way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because tomorrow's not here yet!
It isn’t today!
There's more than one path.
There's more than one way.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Leraime then got quiet.
We sat there together.
We sat in the silence.
Admired the weather.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then I said, “Thanks!
That was a great chat.
I had a great sit.
Now it's time to head back.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So I did.
And as I slowly walked,
I pensively pondered
all these new thoughts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I realized I did seem to run quite a lot.
And that was the first day I’d decided to not. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Instead, I had strolled. 
I just followed each shoe,
for no rhyme or reason - 
just something different to do.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>And I'd had such a good day!
The best I'd had in a while.
And I used not one gizmo,
I realized with a smile.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That day changed my life.
That meeting with Leraime.
I don't really think about life quite the same. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I try to live slower. 
I take more deep breaths.
I walk a lot more.
I run a lot less.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I buy a thingamajig
or a whatzit,
I think about the Big Man -
why he wants me to want it. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Well, that's my story.
That's what the being said to me.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you went, would you find them?
There's no guarantee.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But a walk would be good. 
It would help clear your mind.
And who's to say
what happenings you might find.</p>

        <div class="abstract"><h3>Abstract</h3> <p>To VC or Not to VC, my final project for CTS1000 (2023). Wordcount of ~800, mixed media physical collage, made of various materials, including (but not limited to), graph paper, construction paper, adhesive tape, glue, stickers, ink markers, acrylic paint, as well as cut-outs from 2 magazines: Anatomy Essentials by Future plc, and The Nib Issue 15, a social, political, and scientific comic collective by various artists. Creating a traditional zine rather than a digitally rendered zine was challenging and tedious, however, the result was visually complex and effectively presented itself as both an informational and artistic piece. Utilizing the template of a zine to present research was also relevant to the chosen keyword related to the assignment, "gender". In the 80s and 90s, zines such as Shocking Pink, Bikini Kill, and Doris were published by feminist movement groups to spread information that was not present in the news and media. Creating zines is a challenging form of art and a historical form of publicity, and holds great importance to display and pay homage to the relationship it has with the history of gender and feminism.</p></div>
