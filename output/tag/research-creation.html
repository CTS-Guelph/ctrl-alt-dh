<p>Jared, Arya, Leah, and Jessica discuss the process of creating CTS*4000’s student journal on pop culture. Within this podcast, we get the chance to discuss what drove us to start this journal, along with how our groups were structured and the difficulties that we encountered during the semester. We were able to dive into exciting pop culture topics like virtual fashion shows and cryptocurrencies and even discuss future topics of interest like music, film, and sports. Our discussion also covers pop culture's impact on emotions and its significance to students as a means to escape reality during difficult times like exam seasons. As a group, we also touched on the topic of augmented reality and how that will impact our generation.</p>
<p>When discussing advice for future students looking to submit a project similar to ours, I suggest everybody record their own parts on their own phone to ensure all audio is even when it comes to editing. I was able to take all of our individual parts and edit out the background feedback on Garageband (any music software would work). </p>

        <div class="abstract"><h3>Abstract</h3> <p>This poem was part of a series for my second-year Culture and Technology Studies course, CTS*2010: Digital Approaches to Culture. Over the course of the semester, I explored the position of microchips in our political economy and the part they play in our future-building. Through my research, it became clear that microchips have an integral role in our digital development, and that the systems in which they are used and developed are deeply integrated into the fabric of the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy. Inspired by the exploration of 'low theory' by Judith Jack Halberstam and Steven Johnson's description of 'the adjacent possible', this piece asserts the role of radical imagination in decoupling technology from systems of oppression.</p></div>

        <div class="abstract"><h3>Abstract</h3> <p>To VC or Not to VC, my final project for CTS1000 (2023). Wordcount of ~800, mixed media physical collage, made of various materials, including (but not limited to), graph paper, construction paper, adhesive tape, glue, stickers, ink markers, acrylic paint, as well as cut-outs from 2 magazines: Anatomy Essentials by Future plc, and The Nib Issue 15, a social, political, and scientific comic collective by various artists. Creating a traditional zine rather than a digitally rendered zine was challenging and tedious, however, the result was visually complex and effectively presented itself as both an informational and artistic piece. Utilizing the template of a zine to present research was also relevant to the chosen keyword related to the assignment, "gender". In the 80s and 90s, zines such as Shocking Pink, Bikini Kill, and Doris were published by feminist movement groups to spread information that was not present in the news and media. Creating zines is a challenging form of art and a historical form of publicity, and holds great importance to display and pay homage to the relationship it has with the history of gender and feminism.</p></div>
