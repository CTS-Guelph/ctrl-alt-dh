</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>The Culture and Technology Studies (CTS) program at the University of Guelph explores what it means to live in a digital world, examining the multifaceted issues that technology has brought into our lives. The chosen theme of this year’s <em>CTRL+ALT+DH</em> student journal, Digital Dilemmas, invites us to think critically about the benefits, ethical complexities, and unforeseen consequences brought on by technology in our lives, as well as to imagine potential solutions. </p>
<p>In an age where technology permeates almost every aspect of life, our theme promotes discussion about the new dilemmas our digital and data-driven world presents, from ethical dilemmas arising from developments in Artificial Intelligence, algorithmic bias, environmental damages, data privacy, surveillance capitalism, and a myriad of others. As Kranzberg’s First Law states, “Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral,” and whether as users or creators, we must understand the consequences of the online spaces we inhabit.  By reflecting on the problems that lurk below the surface of our screens, we hope that our work extends from beyond this journal, and that readers take away new understandings and questions about the technology we’ve come to rely on every day.</p>
<p>Now in its second issue, the <em>CTRL+ALT+DH</em> journal gives undergraduate CTS students an opportunity to publish their work in a peer-reviewed periodical. This year, we expanded the scope of the journal, for the first time accepting submissions from across the University of Guelph (and beyond!), fostering inclusive and interdisciplinary dialogue about the ethical, social, and cultural challenges of our digital age.</p>
<p>This special issue engages with diverse topics, featuring a record number of submissions ranging from traditional academic papers: “‘Hey, it's been a while.’: The Spectacle of Wrongdoing and Recovery on YouTube” by Neluka Ameresekere, Susane Dang, and Jingyi Long, “Alive in their Garden: A Virtual Exploration of Art, Identity, and Technology” by Sabine Dajani, “Should Online Pornography be Regulated?” by Anonymous, “Nothing in Life is Free: Uncovering the Hidden Costs of Technology” by Amelia Flynn, and “Writing Against Erasure: Feminist Strategies for Navigating Bias and Exclusion on Wikipedia” by Wolfgang Edwards Van Muijen; as well as a variety of other mediums and creative works: “The Social Media Effect” by Jack Hunter-Buffington, “Accessible Mapping Tools for All” by Emily Aimola, “A Million Tomorrows” by Kurhula Mbetse, “To VC or Not to VC” by Sam Winnick, and “Resist: A Short Story” by Amir Mokrane Benkelai.</p>
<p>The student team of <em>CTRL+ALT+DH</em> is proud to bring you the new issue, and we hope that this collection of submissions inspires our readers to reflect critically on the digital dilemmas of today and look toward a more hopeful future. </p>
<h2>Special Thanks</h2>
<p>The <em>CTRL+ALT+DH</em> team would like to extend a special thank-you to: </p>
<ul>
<li>our instructor, Dr. Chelsea Miya, for leading this iteration of CTS*4000 and going above and beyond to turn our vision for this issue into reality;</li>
<li>our peer reviewers, for their time and expertise in providing thoughtful feedback on submissions that ensured the quality of content in this issue;</li>
<li>our GRA, Kathryn Cobbler, for reviewing and copyediting submissions to professional standards before publication in our times of need; and</li>
<li>the College of Arts, for supporting our journal through promotion and funding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we would like to thank the undergraduate students who contributed to this issue.  We are thrilled at the record amount of submissions we received this year, and the <em>CTRL+ALT+DH</em>  journal would not be possible without your hard work and creativity.</p>                    </article>
